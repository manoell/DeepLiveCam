Try the following:

uninstall the current version of basicsr:
pip uninstall basicsr -y

install basicsr directly from its GitHub repository:
pip install git+https://github.com/xinntao/BasicSR.git@master

After installation is complete, also reinstall gfpgan:
pip uninstall gfpgan -y
pip install git+https://github.com/TencentARC/GFPGAN.git@master

This should resolve your issue.
